  Please report any issues with the container [here](https://github.com/imagegenius/docker-obico/issues)!

  The webui is at `<your ip>:3334`.

  **After starting the container, it is important to configure obico-server (Django) to ensure that all assets are properly loaded. Follow steps 1-2 under 'Login as Django admin' and 'Configure Django site' in the [Obico Server Configuration](https://www.obico.io/docs/server-guides/configure/#login-as-django-admin) guide closely. These steps will guide you through setting up login credentials and configuring the domain name to match the IP used to access the container, or your FQDN if using a reverse proxy.**

  You can also use environment variables to set various configurations, such as email settings. A list of available environment variables can be found [here](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/obico-server/blob/release/docker-compose.yml#L13-L40).

  Note: Some assets, such as the database (obico configuration) and media files (such as timelapses), are mounted to `/config` and will persist through container recreation. I am still working on identifying all assets that require persistence."

  Obico do not publish versioning for obico-server, so we use the latest commit hash to identify the current version.
